# Image-Processing-Using-OpenCV-Matplotlib-and-Pillow


Visual information is the most important type of information perceived, processed and interpreted by the human brain. Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to extract some useful information from it. An image is nothing more than a two dimensional matrix (3-D in case of coloured images) which is defined by the mathematical function f(x,y) where x and y are the two co-ordinates horizontally and vertically. The value of f(x,y) at any point is gives the pixel value at that point of an image, the pixel value describes how bright that pixel is, and/or what color it should be.

For grayscale images the pixel value is a single number that represents the brightness of that pixel, the most common pixel format is the byte image, which is stored as an 8-bit integer giving a range of possible values from 0 to 255. As a convention is taken to be black, and 255 is taken to be white the values in between make up the different shades of gray.

To represent color images, separate red, green and blue components must be specified for each pixel (assuming a RGB color model), and so the pixel `value’ becomes a vector of three numbers. Often the three different components are stored as three separate `grayscale’ images known as color planes (one for each of red, green and blue), which have to be recombined when displaying or processing.
